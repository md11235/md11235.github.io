* lisp DNA

If we ask ourselves, ‘What is the genotype of Lisp?’, what is its DNA, its genetic legacy, I'd suggest that it is composed of the following five ideas.

1. Recursion as the primary mean of expressing procedure calling.
2. Heterogenous lists as the way of composing and dissecting complex data.
3. Programming by defining functions.
4. Garbage collection.
5. Programs as data.
