To reset files permissions, follow these easy 3 steps:

* Step 1: Run “cmd” as Administrator.

Note: In MS Windows 8 and above, press the Win+X keys, then choose “Command Prompt (Admin)”.

* Step 2: Go to the drive or folder in question, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
CD /D D:
#+END_SRC

* Step 3: To reset all the files permissions, type:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
icacls * /T /Q /C /RESET
#+END_SRC

That’s it! After that, the files permissions were reset and I could access them back again.

Very Important note:

Step 3 is irreversible. Make sure you backup the permissions before you proceed!

* Optional Step 2.5

It is possible that “icacls” might fail. For that try to take ownership of the files first. Just before Step (3), please type the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
takeown /R /F *
#+END_SRC
